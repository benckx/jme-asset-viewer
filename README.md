# About

3D assets made in Blender don't always appear as expected in jMonkeyEngine games.

This tool is to help smooth work between 3D designers and developers, by providing 3D designers a simple GUI to quickly
test assets in a jMonkeyEngine scene and change their settings at runtime.

# How To

## Run

* **From the zip file:** Uncompress and simply run the bat file `viewer.bat`
* **From source code:** Run the Main file in your favorite IDE.

### Arguments

- `skip-jme` doesn't show the JME setting window on start-up
- `no-lighting` doesn't add lights to the scene

## Navigate the Scene

- Move with right-click or WASD keys
- Zoom in and out with mouse wheel
- Rotate with B and N or by pressing Left Control when moving with right-click

The app uses the [*ouistiti* camera manager library](https://github.com/benckx/ouistiti).

## Build

```
./gradlew clean build
```

## Update dependencies

```
 ./gradlew dependencyUpdates --refresh-dependencies
```

# Known Issues

## File Selection on Linux

```
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  20 (X_GetProperty)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x9c0007c
  Serial number of failed request:  2511
  Current serial number in output stream:  2511
```

It doesn't happen when only the GUI is loaded.

## Offset Bounding Box

The green Bounding Box that highlights asset selection in the JME scene shifts out of its center when the asset is
scaled or rotated. I think it has to do with the w rotation parameter, as I don't fully
understand [Quaternion](https://javadoc.jmonkeyengine.org/v3.4.0-stable/index.html) yet

# Change logs

## Version 1.1

* Fix bug where cloned assets would not be found on scene reload
* Delete selected asset from scene with the DELETE key
* Fix spelling mistakes

## Version 1.0

* Import/Add Assets to the scene
* Move, rotate, scale assets (by editing text fields values or with mouse wheel)
* Delete an asset from the scene
* Clone/Duplicate an asset from the scene
* Scan folders and list all assets to the "Library" panel
* Automatic save of the scene
