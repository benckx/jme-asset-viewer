# About

3D assets made in Blender don't always appear as expected in my jMonkeyEngine game.

Therefore, I made this tool to help smooth work between 3D designers and developers, by giving 3D designers a tool to
quickly add some assets to a jMonkeyEngine scene.

# How To

## Run

Run the Main file. There is no runnable yet.

## Build

```
./gradlew clean build
```

## Update dependencies

```
 ./gradlew dependencyUpdates --refresh-dependencies
```
